FastAPI does a great job of getting people started with APIs quickly. This talk will point out some obstacles and dark spots that I wish we had known about before. In this talk we want to highlight solutions. This talk will include the following: pydantic fastAPI is built on the shoulders of giants I: pydantic FastAPI makes extensive use of [pydantic. pydantic]!(https://docs.pydantic.dev/) parses data, can validate (and transform) data, and has built-in interfaces to export OpenAPI definitions among many other features. starlette fastAPI is built on the shoulders of giants I: [starlette]!(https://www.starlette.io/) Routes and middleware are managed by starlette. In this section we will explore how to create custom middleware and what we learned along the way. fastAPI has tutorials, but is this documentation? The fastAPI page provides a good introduction. The more we worked with fastAPI, the harder it was to find accurate documentation. Looking at the source code, we really missed DocStrings! Introspection to the rescue - will probably include a rant about missing DocStrings! pydantic DRY (\"Don't repeat yourself\") with pydantic For our use case, we decided to use strict models to validate our data structures, as we work in a highly regulated industry where no mistakes are allowed to happen. Setting up the REST API was much easier than developing consistent models that generalise well. We follow the \"single source of truth\" paradigm, entering redundant definitions is an absolute no-go. In this section we show how to create highly reusable pydantic model pools with inheritance for use in fastAPI. For testing, we also created models from metadata! \"The road not taken\": pydantic Depends()! API routes often consist of a request model and a response model. But what about cases where the models alone don't work and a model and e.g. query parameters need to be mixed? Apart from flake8 complaining about having callables in the signature, this can be quite a difficult use case. Strategies for resolving model/parameter conflicts. Bonus - if time: Integrating fastAPI with Sphinx. Demonstrate how to integrate OpenAPI with your Sphinx documentation. Based on experience building a data hub in asset management, the talk will show how fastAPI is built and how well introspection can help you understand what is going on under the hood and which library is actually doing the heavy lifting where.

It has a thriving community and educational documentation. FastAPI does a great job of getting people started with APIs quickly. This talk will point out some obstacles and dark spots that I wish we had known about before. In this talk we want to highlight solutions. This talk will include the following:","title":"\u2728 fastAPI facts we wish we'd known beforehand."},{"location":"08_fast_ape/#pydantic","text":"fastAPI is built on the shoulders of giants I: pydantic FastAPI makes extensive use of [pydantic. pydantic]!(https://docs.pydantic.dev/) parses data, can validate (and transform) data, and has built-in interfaces to export OpenAPI definitions among many other features.","title":"pydantic"},{"location":"08_fast_ape/#starlette","text":"fastAPI is built on the shoulders of giants I: [starlette]!(https://www.starlette.io/) Routes and middleware are managed by starlette. In this section we will explore how to create custom middleware and what we learned along the way. fastAPI has tutorials, but is this documentation? The fastAPI page provides a good introduction. The more we worked with fastAPI, the harder it was to find accurate documentation. Looking at the source code, we really missed DocStrings! Introspection to the rescue - will probably include a rant about missing DocStrings!","title":"starlette"},{"location":"08_fast_ape/#pydantic_1","text":"DRY (\"Don't repeat yourself\") with pydantic For our use case, we decided to use strict models to validate our data structures, as we work in a highly regulated industry where no mistakes are allowed to happen. Setting up the REST API was much easier than developing consistent models that generalise well. We follow the \"single source of truth\" paradigm, entering redundant definitions is an absolute no-go. In this section we show how to create highly reusable pydantic model pools with inheritance for use in fastAPI. For testing, we also created models from metadata! \"The road not taken\": pydantic Depends()! API routes often consist of a request model and a response model. But what about cases where the models alone don't work and a model and e.g. query parameters need to be mixed? Apart from flake8 complaining about having callables in the signature, this can be quite a difficult use case. Strategies for resolving model/parameter conflicts. Bonus - if time: Integrating fastAPI with Sphinx. Demonstrate how to integrate OpenAPI with your Sphinx documentation. Based on experience building a data hub in asset management, the talk will show how fastAPI is built and how well introspection can help you understand what is going on under the hood and which library is actually doing the heavy lifting where.","title":"pydantic"},{"location":"08_fast_ape/#why-fast-api","text":"High performance web framework instead of flask custom python package interface to FASTAPI current version 259 classes 6022 lines of code more docstrings","title":"Why Fast API"},{"location":"09_pandas_polar/","text":"Pandas 2, Dask or Polars? Quickly tackling larger data on a single machine 06-03, 15:45\u201316:25 (Europe/London), Salisbury Pandas 2 brings new Arrow data types, faster calculations and better scalability. Dask scales Pandas across cores. Polars is a new competitor to Pandas designed around Arrow with native multicore support. Which should you choose for modern research workflows? We'll solve a \"just about fits in ram\" data task using the 3 solutions, talking about the pros and cons so you can make the best choice for your research workflow. You'll leave with a clear idea of whether Pandas 2, Dask or Polars is the tool for your team to invest in. Do you still need 5x working RAM for Pandas operations (probably not!)? Can Pandas string operations actually be fast (sure)? Since Polars uses Arrow data structures, can we easily use tools like Scikit-learn and matplotlib (yes-maybe)? What limits do we still face? How well does Dask handle the updates from Pandas 2? We'll discuss all of these questions along with timed results so you'll have evidence to take back to your team. Giles Weaver Data scientist.

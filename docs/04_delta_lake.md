# Delta Lake 101: How many water metaphors does it take to describe data?

06-02, 15:30â€“17:00 (Europe/London), Warwick

Delta Lake is an open-source storage framework that enables the creation of a 
Lakehouse architecture using a variety of compute engines such as Spark,
PrestoDB, Flink, Trino, and Hive from Python. Its high data reliability and 
optimized query performance make it an ideal solution for supporting big data 
use cases, including batch and streaming data ingestion, fast interactive 
queries, and machine learning.

Apple was using parquet files and it didn't scale so delta got created 

In this tutorial, you will learn about the current requirements in modern data 
engineering and the challenges faced by data engineers in ensuring data 
reliability and performance. We will delve into how Delta Lake can help 
overcome these obstacles, through presentations, hands-on code examples and 
notebooks.

By the end of the tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how 
Delta Lake can be applied to your data architecture and the benefits it can 
bring. Additionally, you will gain insight into how the wider open-source 
community is utilizing Delta Lake as an open standard to develop the next 
generation of data engineering and data science tools in Python.

### Delta Rust API
delta-rs: This library provides low level access to Delta tables in Rust, 
which can be used with data processing frameworks like datafusion, ballista, 
polars, vega, etc. It also provides bindings to other higher level languages 
such as Python or Ruby.

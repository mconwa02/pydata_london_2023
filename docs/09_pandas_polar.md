# Pandas 2, Dask or Polars?

Quickly tackling larger data on a single machine

06-03, 15:45â€“16:25 (Europe/London), Salisbury

Pandas 2 brings new Arrow data types, faster calculations and better scalability. Dask scales Pandas across cores. Polars is a new competitor to Pandas designed around Arrow with native multicore support. Which should you choose for modern research workflows? We'll solve a "just about fits in ram" data task using the 3 solutions, talking about the pros and cons so you can make the best choice for your research workflow. You'll leave with a clear idea of whether Pandas 2, Dask or Polars is the tool for your team to invest in.

Do you still need 5x working RAM for Pandas operations (probably not!)? Can Pandas string operations actually be fast (sure)? Since Polars uses Arrow data structures, can we easily use tools like Scikit-learn and matplotlib (yes-maybe)? What limits do we still face? How well does Dask handle the updates from Pandas 2? We'll discuss all of these questions along with timed results so you'll have evidence to take back to your team.

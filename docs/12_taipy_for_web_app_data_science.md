# How to build stunning Data Science Web applications in Python

06-04, 11:45â€“12:25 (Europe/London), Warwick

This talk presents Taipy, a new low-code Python package that allows you to create complete Data Science applications, including graphical visualization and managing algorithms, pipelines, and scenarios.

It is composed of two main independent components:

* Taipy Core

* Taipy GUI.

In this talk, participants will learn how to use:

Taipy GUI to create an interactive and powerful user interface in a few lines of code.

Taipy Core to create scenarios, use models, retrieve metrics easily, version control their application configuration,

Taipy Studio, a brand-new pipeline graphical editor inside VS Code also that facilitates the creation of scenarios and pipelines.

They will be used to build a complete interactive AI application where the end user can explore data and execute pipelines (make predictions) from within the application.

With Taipy, the Python developer can transform simple pilots into production-ready end-user applications. Taipy GUI goes way beyond the capabilities of the standard graphical stack: Gradio, Streamlit, Dash, etc.

Similarly, Taipy Core is simpler yet more powerful than the standard Python back-end stack.
